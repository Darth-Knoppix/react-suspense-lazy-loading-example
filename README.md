# React Suspense Lazy Loading

This app is designed to show how lazy loading can be easily used to load only
what is needed to render a particular route.

A different library is used for each of the following routes to show why you
might like to defer loading the entire bundle when a user is only viewing a
single page.

- *Dashboard* - Chart.js
- *Locales* - Moment
- *Flow* - Flowpoints
